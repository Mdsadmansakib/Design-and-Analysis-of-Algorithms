## Introduction

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. The key insight is that many problems have overlapping subproblems that can be solved once and their results stored for future use, leading to significant performance improvements.

The technique was introduced by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has since become fundamental in computer science, mathematics, and optimization theory.

## Core Concepts

### Optimal Substructure
A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems. This property allows us to build solutions incrementally.

### Overlapping Subproblems
When solving a problem recursively, the same subproblems are solved multiple times. Dynamic programming identifies these overlapping subproblems and stores their solutions to avoid redundant calculations.

### Memoization vs Tabulation
- **Memoization (Top-down)**: Store results of expensive function calls and return cached results when same inputs occur again
- **Tabulation (Bottom-up)**: Build solutions iteratively, starting from base cases and working up to the final solution

## Types of Dynamic Programming

### 1. Linear Dynamic Programming
Problems where the state depends on a linear sequence of previous states.

**Examples:**
- Fibonacci sequence
- Climbing stairs
- House robber problem

### 2. Grid/2D Dynamic Programming
Problems involving 2D grids or matrices where solutions depend on neighboring cells.

**Examples:**
- Unique paths in a grid
- Minimum path sum
- Edit distance

### 3. Interval Dynamic Programming
Problems where solutions are built by considering intervals or ranges.

**Examples:**
- Matrix chain multiplication
- Palindrome partitioning
- Optimal binary search tree

### 4. Tree Dynamic Programming
Problems involving tree structures where solutions depend on subtrees.

**Examples:**
- Maximum path sum in binary tree
- Diameter of binary tree
- House robber in binary tree

### 5. Bitmask Dynamic Programming
Problems where states are represented using bitmasks.

**Examples:**
- Traveling salesman problem
- Subset sum with constraints
- Assignment problems

## Common Use Cases

- Finding minimum or maximum values

### Sequence Problems

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Fibonacci Sequence (Memoization)
```python
def fibonacci_memo(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    memo[n] = fibonacci_memo(n-1, memo) + fibonacci_memo(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

### Example 2: Coin Change Problem (Tabulation)
```python
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1
```

### Example 3: Longest Common Subsequence
```python
def lcs(text1, text2):
    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
    
    return dp[m][n]
```

### Example 4: 0/1 Knapsack Problem
```python
def knapsack(weights, values, capacity):
    n = len(weights)
    dp = [[0] * (capacity + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(
                    dp[i-1][w],
                    dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]] + values[i-1]
                )
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    
    return dp[n][capacity]
```
